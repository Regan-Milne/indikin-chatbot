Indikin Site Research Document
1. Platform Overview

Mission & Vision: Indikin is a decentralized ecosystem aiming to accelerate the financing and distribution of independent films by empowering filmmakers with web3 tools
indikin.online
. The platform’s vision is to establish a “true creator economy,” where independent storytellers can fund projects, retain creative control, and connect directly with audiences and investors without traditional middlemen
indikin.online
. Indikin positions itself as “the biggest thing happening to PulseChain since launch” – leveraging the PulseChain blockchain to foster an inclusive, creator-led economy for indie cinema
indikin.com
.

What Indikin Is: Indikin comprises a suite of products and services for filmmakers and their audiences. At its core is IndiFlix, the streaming arm of Indikin, which serves as a native distribution platform for independent films
indikin.com
. Indikin.online is the main gateway to this ecosystem, described as a hub for a new creator-led economy in film
indikin.com
. The ecosystem is powered by the $INDIKIN token and individual filmmaker tokens, enabling a tokenized economy around film projects
indikin.online
indikin.online
. Indikin’s motto “Stream bold stories. Support independent voices.” emphasizes direct creator-to-audience engagement: viewers become supporters of the filmmakers by watching on the platform
indikin.online
.

Problems Addressed: Indikin explicitly targets four key challenges faced by independent filmmakers
indikin.online
indikin.online
:

Funding: Traditional funding requires lengthy crowdfunding campaigns, chasing grants, or appeasing investors, often costing filmmakers time, money, and control over their projects
indikin.online
.

Distribution: Even when films are completed, getting seen is hard – festival circuits and online platforms are hit-or-miss, and the competitive “attention economy” means most indie films struggle to generate sufficient revenue
indikin.online
.

Exposure: It’s difficult for independent productions to gain visibility in a crowded marketplace. Without proper exposure, even quality films may not find their audience
indikin.online
.

Intellectual Property: Filmmakers who do find success often lose IP rights through unfavorable deals made out of necessity or manipulation, sacrificing ownership of their own work
indikin.online
.

Ecosystem Solution: Indikin’s solution is to leverage web3 principles to tackle these issues holistically
indikin.online
indikin.online
. Key elements of how the ecosystem works include:

Multi-Token Funding Model: Instead of traditional fundraising, each filmmaker in Indikin launches their own cryptocurrency token (a Filmmaker Token). Supporters can buy these tokens to back the filmmaker. A portion (10%) of every filmmaker’s token supply must be deposited into the Indikin Production Fund to join the ecosystem, creating a shared stake in each project
indikin.online
indikin.online
. This works like a decentralized, tokenized form of crowdfunding combined with a “scholarship-like” grants program for proven creators
indikin.online
.

Bonded Token Index: Filmmaker tokens are bonded to the $INDIKIN token, meaning each filmmaker’s token is paired with $INDIKIN in the ecosystem. All bonded tokens collectively form the Indikin Filmmaker Token Index, representing the roster of filmmakers in Indikin
indikin.online
indikin.online
. This design incentivizes collaboration: any trading activity on a filmmaker’s token generates rewards in PulseChain’s DEX token (PLSX) for all $INDIKIN holders, thus tying the success of each filmmaker to the whole community
indikin.online
.

Decentralized Distribution (IndiFlix): Indikin operates its own streaming platform (“IndiFlix”) where filmmakers can distribute their productions directly to viewers
indikin.online
. By distributing via Indikin’s platform, filmmakers can take advantage of smart-contract-managed split revenues – meaning the income from on-demand streams is automatically shared among stakeholders (filmmaker, crew, token holders, and the communal fund) according to predefined percentages
indikin.online
indikin.online
. This transparent revenue-sharing model ensures that everyone who contributed to a film’s success (both creatively and financially) can receive a fair cut in real time
indikin.online
.

Community & Creator Economy: Indikin fosters a sense of “Independent Kinship” among creators and audiences on PulseChain
indikin.com
. Filmmakers in the ecosystem support each other, and audiences are treated as part of the team. Fans can become token holders and even earn rewards from a film’s success (see Tokenomics below), blurring the line between creator, investor, and audience
indikin.online
. The top 50 holders of a filmmaker’s token are eligible to receive a share of that film’s streaming revenue, which turns engaged fans into active stakeholders in the film’s performance
indikin.online
.

Retention of Creative Control: By raising funds via their own tokens and distributing through Indikin, filmmakers can retain ownership of their IP and creative direction. There are strict rules in place within Indikin to protect filmmakers’ rights; for example, if a filmmaker accepts production funding from the communal fund, they themselves decide the revenue split arrangements before entering the deal
indikin.online
. This is aimed to prevent the loss of IP or unfair profit-sharing that is common in traditional studio deals.

IndiFlix and PulseChain: The choice of PulseChain as the underlying blockchain is a notable aspect of Indikin’s strategy. PulseChain (a high-throughput, EVM-compatible Layer-1) allows Indikin to issue tokens and manage micro-transactions (like streaming payments) with low fees
indikin.online
indikin.online
. All Indikin-related tokens (the $INDIKIN token and all filmmaker tokens) currently exist exclusively on PulseChain
indikin.com
. By focusing on PulseChain’s community (which originated from the HEX crypto community), Indikin hopes to tap into an existing base of crypto-savvy supporters. In fact, Indikin markets itself as “a cinematic arrival of independent kinship on PulseChain”, suggesting it sees PulseChain as a fertile ground for building a new decentralized film economy
indikin.com
.

Current Status: Indikin is in an early access phase as of late 2025. Indikin.online is live as the entry point, and the streaming service (IndiFlix) has launched with an initial library of independent films. To encourage early adoption, Indikin is offering a limited-time Indikin Pass (an annual all-access subscription) at discounted stages (see Features & Functionality)
indikin.online
indikin.online
. The platform is actively onboarding filmmakers (with five founding filmmakers already on board) and is holding weekly community calls (open “Creator Gatherings” every Wednesday) to update on development and welcome new interested creators
indikin.com
.

2. Features & Functionality

IndiFlix Streaming Platform: Indikin’s core feature is IndiFlix, a decentralized streaming service for independent films. It allows viewers to watch films that are uploaded directly by their creators, with “no middlemen, no studios, just pure storytelling”
indikin.online
. Through Indikin.online (the IndiFlix portal), users can discover and stream exclusive independent films, documentaries, and creative projects. The platform emphasizes that by watching on IndiFlix, viewers are directly supporting creators – since revenue flows back to filmmakers and their teams via smart contracts
indikin.online
. IndiFlix is positioned as the ecosystem’s home for content distribution and is now live and accessible to anyone with an account or an Indikin Pass
indikin.com
.

Indikin Pass (Subscription Membership): To simplify viewer access and seed the community, Indikin offers an Indikin Pass – a one-year subscription that grants unlimited, ad-free streaming of all content in the Indikin library
indikin.online
indikin.online
. This Pass is sold in stages (Stage 1 through Stage 5) with increasing prices as more passes are sold:

Stage 1 Pass: $49 for 1 year (sold out) – included perks like priority consideration to become an Indikin filmmaker, one-year unlimited streaming of Indikin Originals, and invitations to private pre-screenings of new releases
indikin.online
.

Stage 2 Pass: $99 for 1 year (current stage) – includes professional support from the Indikin filmmaker community, early access to new features/partners on the platform, and bonus content from creators
indikin.online
.

Stage 3 Pass: $149 for 1 year – includes global distribution of your productions on IndiFlix (for creators who have films to release), the ability to launch your own filmmaker token through the Indikin platform, and early access to new merchandise from creators
indikin.online
.

Stage 4 Pass: $199 for 1 year – includes priority access to additional creator rewards, immediate capability to start rewarding one’s top token holders with $INDIKIN tokens, and the opportunity for Pass holders to earn streaming revenue from creators they support by holding those creators’ tokens (i.e. fan investors can get earnings, if such token-revenue programs exist)
indikin.online
.

Stage 5 Pass: $249 for 1 year (final pricing) – includes priority access to apply for the Indikin Production Fund (for funding one’s film projects), priority access to the Indikin Grants Program, and even access to “Query AI Filmmaking Industry Agent Gorge Pukas” (an AI assistant related to the industry)
indikin.online
.

All Indikin Pass purchases are one-time (no auto-renewal) and contribute to funding the ecosystem’s growth
indikin.online
. The Pass serves a dual purpose: it is a value proposition for viewers (all-you-can-watch plus perks) and an onboarding tool for creators (certain tiers give filmmakers resources to launch their project on Indikin). This tiered membership approach is a unique feature to bootstrap a user base and incentivize early adopters to engage deeply with the platform.

Multi-Token Creator Economy: Each filmmaker on Indikin has their own personal crypto token (Filmmaker Token) integrated into the platform’s economy. These tokens aren’t just theoretical – they are actively traded on PulseChain’s DEX and tracked by Indikin:

Filmmaker tokens are listed with tickers (e.g. $GDAY, $WUPIUPI, $LOLA, $TEED, $HAL, $SCOOT, etc.) and can be viewed on blockchain explorers or charts (Indikin links to DexScreener for each token’s market chart)
indikin.com
indikin.com
. Fans or investors can buy/sell these tokens on PulseX (the PulseChain DEX) to speculate on or support a filmmaker’s future success
indikin.online
.

Utility of Filmmaker Tokens: Beyond speculation, holding a filmmaker’s token can confer benefits within the Indikin ecosystem. Notably, Indikin’s smart contracts allow filmmakers to share a portion of their streaming revenue with their token holders. As mentioned, the top 50 holders of any filmmaker’s token become eligible to earn a share of that filmmaker’s film streaming revenues
indikin.online
. This means fans who truly believe in a creator can buy and hold their token and literally profit if the creator’s films do well on IndiFlix – a novel functionality that aligns incentives among creators and their audience.

The Indikin Filmmaker Token Index is an index representing all these tokens combined, essentially reflecting the overall “market cap” or performance of the entire roster of Indikin filmmakers
indikin.online
. By holding the $INDIKIN token, one gets indirect exposure to the success of all filmmakers in the index (see Tokenomics section). This multi-token structure is a distinguishing feature of Indikin’s functionality, setting it apart from single-token crowdfunding models.

Fair Revenue Sharing (Smart Contracts): Revenue from film rentals or streams on IndiFlix is distributed automatically via smart contracts. Indikin’s platform is built such that when a viewer pays to watch a film, the payment is split among stakeholders according to preset ratios managed by contracts
indikin.online
indikin.online
. The typical split involves:

A portion to the filmmaker (and by extension their production team),

A portion directly to that filmmaker’s token holders (rewarding the community/investors who backed the project),

A portion to the Indikin Production Fund (to sustain the ecosystem and fund future projects),

Optionally, portions to other collaborators (e.g. co-creators, crew members could have addresses that receive a cut).

These splits are configured by the filmmaker when they join Indikin’s funding program
indikin.online
. The transparency and trustlessness of this system ensure that if a film earns money, it’s immediately shared with those who are entitled – no waiting for quarterly royalty statements or studio accounting. Indikin emphasizes this as “transparent revenue-sharing that allows filmmakers to distribute earnings to everyone who contributed to their success”
indikin.online
. This feature motivates contributors and investors to help promote the film, since their earnings are directly proportional to the film’s viewership.

Payment Options (Fiat & Crypto): Indikin.online caters to both crypto enthusiasts and general audiences by supporting multiple payment methods for content:

Traditional Payment: Users can pay with standard methods (likely credit/debit cards, etc.) to rent or purchase films on the platform, which provides a “seamless viewing experience” for those not familiar with crypto
indikin.online
. This is important for accessibility, allowing anyone to support indie films without needing to hold cryptocurrency.

Cryptocurrency Payment: For blockchain users, Indikin accepts crypto tokens on the PulseChain network to pay for films
indikin.online
. For example, a viewer might pay in $PLS, $INDIKIN, or a filmmaker’s token to unlock a movie. This direct crypto payment option not only provides convenience for crypto users but also directly feeds into the Indikin token economy (since those payments can be routed through the revenue-sharing contracts). It’s also a way for token holders to reinvest their tokens into watching content, creating an internal economy.

By offering both options, Indikin “makes watching films easy” for everyone
indikin.online
, bridging web2 and web3 audiences.

Creator Tools & Onboarding: Indikin provides various tools to help creators join and benefit from the platform:

Filmmaker Onboarding: Filmmakers interested in Indikin can apply on the site (the Privacy Policy notes a filmmaker application form collecting info and links)
indikin.online
. Approved filmmakers launch their own token (Indikin assists with the token creation on PulseChain) and are required to allocate 10% of their token supply to the communal Production Fund as a condition of joining
indikin.online
. Once onboard, they can distribute content via IndiFlix and configure revenue splits to automatically pay their collaborators and supporters
indikin.online
indikin.online
.

Token Launch Support: As noted in the Indikin Pass perks, a Stage 3 Pass provides “Launch your own filmmaker token” support
indikin.online
. This implies the platform has an interface or service to help filmmakers create and list their token easily (handling smart contract deployment, Dex listing, etc.). Essentially, Indikin acts as a token launchpad for film projects.

Global Distribution: Also via the Stage 3 Pass, filmmakers get “Global streaming distribution of your productions” through IndiFlix
indikin.online
. This is a built-in distribution channel – Indikin takes care of hosting and streaming the content globally to all pass holders or paying viewers, sparing filmmakers the need to secure distribution deals or streaming contracts. It is an all-in-one solution (fundraise → produce → distribute on same platform).

Community Support & Collaboration: Indikin’s community aspect is a feature in itself. Pass holders get access to the Indikin Filmmaker community for pro support
indikin.online
 – likely a forum or Discord where creators can get advice from peers (the five founding filmmakers and other experienced members). Indikin also hosts a weekly Creator Gathering (via Google Meet) open to filmmakers or creators curious about Indikin
indikin.com
. These live meetings allow creators to discuss product updates and share news on their projects, fostering a collaborative environment. This kind of active community engagement is a key value proposition for creators who often work in isolation.

AI Assistant “Gorge Pukas”: A unique feature teased for Stage 5 Pass holders is access to an AI Filmmaking Industry Agent named “Gorge Pukas”
indikin.online
. While details are sparse, this appears to be an AI assistant that can answer industry questions or provide guidance. (The name is likely a play on “George Lucas” – hinting it’s an AI that advises on filmmaking/industry matters.) This shows Indikin’s intent to incorporate cutting-edge tech to benefit creators.

Unique Value Proposition: Indikin’s combination of features creates a unique value prop for both creators and audiences:

For Filmmakers: Indikin offers funding without giving up IP, a built-in audience/community that can become investors, an automated way to share profits (reducing the headache of back-end deals), and a distribution platform that handles payments and streaming. It’s essentially a one-stop ecosystem to launch a filmmaking career or project: from raising capital (via tokens and grants) to distribution and monetization, while keeping creative freedom
indikin.online
indikin.online
. The “Quit Survival Mode. Thrive in Creative Mode.” slogan encapsulates this – freeing filmmakers from the cycle of scraping by, and enabling them to sustainably create
indikin.online
.

For Viewers/Supporters: Indikin turns passive viewers into active participants in the film’s success. By buying a pass or a filmmaker’s token, a fan can literally invest in a film and see returns if it succeeds. They also get closer access to the creators (through pre-screenings, bonus content, community chats). Essentially, it merges entertainment with an opportunity for patronage and investment, all through a user-friendly streaming interface. The average film enthusiast gains access to exclusive indie content and can “be among the first to discover unique stories”
indikin.online
, while supporting emerging talent directly.

Marketplace & Token Trading: While Indikin itself is not an exchange, it integrates with external DeFi infrastructure. Each filmmaker token and the $INDIKIN token can be traded on the PulseX decentralized exchange. Indikin’s site provides quick links to view charts on DexScreener and to buy on PulseX for each token
indikin.online
indikin.online
. This integration ensures that entering or exiting positions in a creator’s token is just a click away. In essence, Indikin has a marketplace element via the blockchain: the value of each filmmaker’s token fluctuates with market demand, giving a real-time indicator of a project’s perceived value. Token holders thus have liquidity – they can sell their stake if they choose, unlike traditional crowdfunding where contributions are sunk costs. This adds a dynamic, market-driven dimension to the platform’s functionality.

Additional Community Features: Indikin maintains official community channels: a Telegram Token Index chat and a Discord Creator Hub
indikin.online
. These resources allow investors and creators to discuss the projects and the tokens. Social media integration is also present (Twitter/X feeds for updates, etc.). Indikin.com lists numerous social links (Telegram, Discord, X/Twitter, YouTube, Reddit, LinkedIn, Facebook, TikTok, Instagram) indicating a broad community outreach
indikin.com
. The platform explicitly encourages web2 content creators with ambitions in film to join, indicating there are on-going campaigns to attract YouTubers, TikTokers, etc., into the ecosystem
indikin.online
.

In summary, Indikin’s platform offers a comprehensive feature set: a streaming service (IndiFlix), a tokenized funding system, revenue-sharing smart contracts, flexible payment options, membership perks, and active community support – all designed to solve the pain points of independent filmmaking through decentralization and community engagement.

3. Tokenomics & Financial Model

$INDIKIN Token (Native Token): The $INDIKIN token is the cornerstone of Indikin’s economy. It is a PRC-20 token on PulseChain (PulseChain’s equivalent of an ERC-20)
indikin.online
, with a fixed supply of 777 billion $INDIKIN minted at launch
indikin.online
. $INDIKIN is designed as a reflection/rewards token: it charges a 1% fee on every swap/transfer, and redistributes that 1% as rewards to all $INDIKIN holders in the form of PLSX (PulseX DEX’s token)
indikin.online
indikin.online
. This means simply holding $INDIKIN in one’s wallet yields a passive income stream of PLSX, proportional to the holder’s share of the $INDIKIN supply. Notably, there’s no staking or lock-up required – rewards accumulate automatically whenever any $INDIKIN transaction occurs, as governed by the token’s smart contract
indikin.online
.

Launch Details: $INDIKIN was launched on April 4, 2025
indikin.online
indikin.online
. On launch, a certain allocation of tokens was distributed among key parties (see below), and liquidity pools were established on PulseX. Initially, two liquidity pairs were created: $INDIKIN/PLS and $INDIKIN/PLSX, each with 5% of the token supply seeded for liquidity
indikin.online
indikin.online
. All trading of Indikin tokens occurs on PulseX (and the platform conveniently provides direct “Buy on PulseX” links for users)
indikin.online
. Contract Address: The contract address of $INDIKIN is 0xC0372486fCab952aA2B7998876d6aa79d4Fc1938 on PulseChain
indikin.com
indikin.online
 (this is publicly provided for transparency).

Initial Allocation of $INDIKIN: The distribution of the 777B supply was designed to bootstrap the ecosystem:

10% to Founding Filmmakers: Five founding independent filmmakers each received equal portions (collectively 10%) of the supply
indikin.online
. In exchange, these founders committed 10% of their own filmmaker token supplies back to the Production Fund (creating mutual skin-in-the-game)
indikin.online
.

10% to Liquidity Pools: 5% of supply went to the PLS/$INDIKIN pool and 5% to the PLSX/$INDIKIN pool on PulseX
indikin.online
. This provided initial liquidity for trading and price discovery.

80% to Indikin Production Fund: The vast majority (approximately 621.6 billion tokens) is held in the Indikin Production Fund wallet, designated for ecosystem development, grants, and production financing
indikin.online
. This fund is essentially the treasury of the project, and it’s controlled by a multi-signature wallet managed by the five founding filmmakers
indikin.online
indikin.online
. The Production Fund’s purpose is to finance new films (through grants or direct investment) and support the platform’s operations long-term.

Indikin Production Fund: This fund is critical to Indikin’s financial model. It holds 80% of $INDIKIN plus any filmmaker token contributions (each new filmmaker deposits 10% of their token supply here)
indikin.online
indikin.online
. The fund grows over time not only from these token allocations but also from accrued rewards (the fund wallet likely also earns PLSX from its $INDIKIN holdings, and it may accumulate other tokens). The five founding filmmakers collectively govern the Production Fund via a Gnosis Safe multisig (a secure multi-signature wallet)
indikin.online
indikin.online
. They convene (monthly, per documentation) to evaluate pitches from filmmakers and decide on fund disbursements for productions or scholarships
indikin.online
. This governance by creators ensures funds are allocated in the best interest of the indie film community rather than by outside investors.

Filmmaker Tokens: Every filmmaker in Indikin launches their own fungible token (akin to a personalized coin). These tokens typically have humorous or project-themed ticker symbols:

For example, Tom Gillespie’s token is $GDAY (“Gillespie Coin”)
indikin.online
, Brian’s token is $WUPIUPI (a reference to an inside joke or character)
indikin.online
, Georgia’s is $LOLA
indikin.online
, Dr Teed’s is $TEED
indikin.online
, Hal’s is $HAL
indikin.online
, and Bitjoin Studios (the production house) even has $SCOOT (Scootercoin) representing it
indikin.online
. These tokens are primarily community and branding tools for the filmmakers – described as “like memecoins” that reflect a filmmaker’s unique style and help build a lasting community around their work
indikin.online
.

Bonding to $INDIKIN: When a filmmaker’s token is launched, it must be bonded with $INDIKIN. In practical terms, bonding likely means a portion of the filmmaker’s token liquidity is paired with $INDIKIN on the DEX, making $INDIKIN a base pair for all these tokens. The result is the Indikin Filmmaker Token Index, which is effectively a composite of all bonded tokens
indikin.online
indikin.online
. If an investor holds $INDIKIN, they indirectly hold a piece of every filmmaker’s token (because $INDIKIN’s value will move with the collective performance). This index approach reduces risk for supporters – instead of betting on one filmmaker, holding $INDIKIN bets on the entire slate of Indikin creators.

Filmmaker Token Rules: To officially join, a filmmaker must allocate 10% of their token supply to the Production Fund (as mentioned)
indikin.online
. As of Q3 2025, all filmmaker tokens must be native to PulseChain (PRC-20) to be recognized
indikin.online
. Filmmakers are also encouraged to create liquidity bonds between their token and others in the Indikin network (even filmmaker-to-filmmaker token bonds), though the key required bond is with $INDIKIN
indikin.online
. This web of bonds fosters a collaborative financial incentive structure among filmmakers.

Rewards & Reflections: The $INDIKIN token’s economics provide continuous incentives:

1% PLSX Reflection: Each transaction of $INDIKIN (buy, sell, or transfer) triggers a 1% fee that is converted to PLSX and distributed to all $INDIKIN holders
indikin.com
indikin.online
. For example, if someone swaps $INDIKIN on PulseX, all holders get a drizzle of PLSX in their wallets. This mechanism rewards long-term holders and also means that as more filmmaker tokens trade (because those tokens are bonded to $INDIKIN, and presumably swaps between a filmmaker’s token and $INDIKIN might count as $INDIKIN transactions), holders see more PLSX rewards. It effectively ties the activity across the ecosystem back into a yield for the community. “$INDIKIN holders always collect 1% PLSX rewards on all swaps and transfers” confirms this benefit
indikin.online
.

Burn Mechanism: To introduce deflationary pressure, Indikin has a rule that 0.1% of the $INDIKIN total supply is burned every time a new filmmaker joins the ecosystem
indikin.online
indikin.online
. This means each time a filmmaker’s token is bonded (which implies they deposited into the fund and officially became part of Indikin), the act of joining destroys a small portion of $INDIKIN. With more filmmakers, $INDIKIN becomes scarcer, theoretically increasing its value to reward holders. Additionally, Indikin mentions that PLSX rewards accumulated by the Production Fund might also be subject to periodic burns as the ecosystem grows
indikin.online
 (to further reduce token supply or perhaps to manage liquidity). All these tokenomic choices aim for a sustainable, value-accretive model that benefits active participants and long-term supporters.

No Lockups for Rewards: Importantly, unlike some DeFi projects, Indikin’s reflection model doesn’t require users to stake or lock their tokens for a period. “$INDIKIN tokenholders do not need to lock their assets to earn PLSX; they earn income almost instantly when a transaction is made”
indikin.online
. This lowers the barrier for participation – anyone holding the token can freely trade or use it and still get rewards.

Indikin Grants Program: The Production Fund isn’t just a static treasury – it has a Grants program to provide a basic income to all active filmmakers. According to the tokenomics:

10% of stabilized value (or stablecoins) in the Production Fund is distributed to filmmakers each month
indikin.online
indikin.online
. In practice, this likely means the fund converts some holdings to a stable asset and then splits 10% of that pot among the filmmakers on a pro-rata basis (perhaps by their token index weight or equally). This acts as a “scholarship-like” support, giving independent creators a small regular revenue so they can continue working on projects
indikin.online
. It’s akin to a universal basic income for the creative community funded by the ecosystem’s successes. Per the roadmap, Indikin Grants will commence one year after $INDIKIN launch (i.e., April 2026) or once the Production Fund reaches a certain size ($100k stabilized value), whichever comes first
indikin.online
.

Production Fund Distribution: Similarly, the platform plans that full Production Fund investments into films will start one year after launch or after the fund hits $500k in value, whichever is first
indikin.online
. This means the large-scale funding of new productions (from that 80% supply) is time-locked to ensure the ecosystem has grown sufficiently and the treasury is robust enough to sustain commitments.

Revenue Flow from Streaming: When viewers pay to watch films on Indikin, the payments can occur in fiat or crypto, but ultimately the revenue is converted to support the ecosystem. If paid in crypto (PulseChain tokens), the smart contract could directly split those tokens: a share going to the filmmaker’s wallet, a share to holders (possibly by automatically buying and distributing filmmaker tokens or $INDIKIN to them), and a share to the fund. If paid via fiat/Stripe, the platform likely converts a portion to crypto to distribute on-chain. The Terms of Service note that part of streaming revenue is allocated to the Indikin Production Fund to support new projects
indikin.online
. They also caution that any “revenue sharing and token benefits depend on filmmakers and market conditions” and no financial returns are guaranteed
indikin.online
 – i.e., this is not an investment promise, but an innovative distribution mechanism subject to the success of films and tokens.

Financial Safety and Compliance: Indikin is careful to include disclaimers that, while it has financial features, it is not providing investment advice or guarantees. The Indikin.com site explicitly states that all information is for educational and entertainment purposes and “should not be considered investment advice.” Users are encouraged to do their own research and consult professionals before making any investment decisions
indikin.com
. The Terms of Service also reinforce that tokens like $GDAY or $LOLA which offer revenue-sharing do so as decided by filmmakers and within legal compliance, and Indikin itself doesn’t guarantee any profit
indikin.online
. This is likely to avoid being classified as offering securities or any form of unlicensed financial product.

PulseChain Integration: Using PulseChain gives Indikin some financial advantages: PulseChain has faster and cheaper transactions than Ethereum mainnet (it uses a Delegated Proof of Stake consensus for efficiency
indikin.online
). This makes micro-transactions feasible (e.g., paying a few cents worth of crypto for a film view and splitting it among many parties can be done without prohibitive gas fees). PulseChain’s EVM-compatibility also means Indikin’s smart contracts and tokens follow familiar standards (ERC-20 like) and the code is portable
indikin.online
. The reliance on PulseChain does concentrate risk (if PulseChain faces issues, Indikin does too), but the team indicates plans to expand to “more chains coming soon”
indikin.online
, suggesting eventual multi-chain deployment for $INDIKIN and the platform.

In summary, Indikin’s tokenomics create a closed-loop economy: Filmmakers and supporters are all token holders; the act of funding, creating, and watching films continuously recirculates value (through reflections, revenue splits, and burns) to the community. The $INDIKIN token ties everything together – it is both an index of the ecosystem’s creative output and a reward mechanism for participation. By aligning financial incentives through smart contracts, Indikin’s model strives for sustainable positive economic activity for independent filmmakers, their backers, and audiences alike

Film: Teed

Logline: Dr. Al Teed – a brilliant yet reckless time-traveling scientist – discovers how to capture time itself in a substance called “Teed,” embarking on mind-bending adventures across history.

Synopsis: Teed is a creative project (short film or web series pilot) that serves as an introduction to the eccentric character Dr. Al Teed. In the story’s lore, Dr. Teed has done the impossible: he has bottled time into a physical token ($TEED), which allows him to travel through time at will (and perhaps trade time as currency). The film likely showcases one of Dr. Teed’s adventures – possibly an origin story of how he invented the Teed substance – blending science fiction with humor. As a transmedia character, Dr. Teed documents his journeys through films, podcasts, and radio dramas
indikin.online
. In this initial installment, expect an imaginative, pseudo-steampunk narrative as Teed leaps through eras and paradoxes in pursuit of knowledge and profit. (Details are inferred from the character description since a full synopsis is not published.)

Genre: Science Fiction / Fantasy (Short Film; pseudo mockumentary style).

Runtime: Unknown (likely a short format content piece).

Creator(s): Created by Dr. Al Teed (real identity: an Indikin founder known as “Dr Teed,” who is a business strategist by background)

Film: The Fakefluencer

Logline: After falling victim to a crypto scam, ex-trader Tom Gillespie sets out to expose the mysterious figure behind “Scootercoin,” only to discover the bizarre intersections of crypto hype and real economics
bitjoinstudios.com
.

Synopsis: The Fakefluencer (2021) is the first film in the Tom Gillespie investigative trilogy. The documentary (presented in a narrative style) follows Tom Gillespie, who, having been scammed by a shilling “fake influencer,” takes it upon himself to track down the supposed founder of Scootercoin, a fictional meme-coin. Tom’s journey takes him around the world, delving deep into cryptocurrency subculture. Along the way, he meets a cast of real and fictional characters, including Bitman 360 – the flamboyant crypto influencer who peddled Scootercoin
bitjoinstudios.com
. The film is part satire, part reality – highlighting that the line between real scams and fictional commentary can be very thin. In a twist of life imitating art, a real Scootercoin cryptocurrency was launched as an outcome of the film’s production (initially as a joke, then evolving into a project)
bitjoinstudios.com

bitjoinstudios.com
indikin.online
. Hal and his cameraman serendipitously were present with cameras rolling, managing to capture the raw and soulful moment. The film is an unfiltered slice of life that celebrates spontaneity, human connection, and the small miracles of timing.

Film: Murder on M/S Marseille Dream

Logline: On a luxury cruise of the world’s brightest minds, a murder unfolds at sea. Every passenger is a suspect, but the investigation takes a sci-fi twist when the detective – Dr. Teed – can solve the mystery by bending time itself
bitjoinstudios.com
.

Synopsis: This project is a unique genre-blend: a murder mystery set on the cruise ship M/S Marseille Dream. The world’s most brilliant scientists and thinkers are gathered on an exclusive voyage, only for a guest to be murdered on a calm Mediterranean night
bitjoinstudios.com
. With a ship full of potential suspects, the task of solving the whodunit falls to Doctor Al Teed. However, Dr. Teed is no ordinary detective – being a time-traveler, he doesn’t just follow clues, he follows time itself to unravel the crime
bitjoinstudios.com
. The story likely involves Teed jumping to different timepoints during the cruise to witness events and discover the culprit, adding a mind-bending temporal element to a classic Agatha Christie-like scenario. Murder on M/S Marseille Dream is both a thrilling narrative and an expansion of the Dr. Teed character’s adventures. It also includes a meta-conversation: a “Deep talk” onboard between Dr. Teed and Tom Gillespie (Tom apparently appears as a cameo in this story)
bitjoinstudios.com
. This interplay further ties the Indikin universe characters together.

Genre: Short Film – Mystery/Sci-Fi.

Runtime: ~10–15 minutes (estimated, short format episodic content).

Creator(s): Directed by Dr. Teed (in-universe; likely written by the team behind the Dr. Teed persona)

5. Creators / Team

Indikin is driven by a team of independent filmmakers and crypto community veterans, dubbed “the Indikins.” There are five Founding Filmmakers and five core PulseChain OG members who together form the backbone of the project
indikin.online
. Below is a list of the publicly listed creators, team members, and filmmakers, along with their roles and brief bios (as provided by Indikin):

Tom Gillespie – Founding Filmmaker. Described as a “DeFi Filmmaker / Crypto Cult Ethnographer,” Tom is known for exploring the underbelly of cryptocurrency culture through film
indikin.com
. He is the central character of Indikin’s flagship documentaries (The Fakefluencer, Hexicans, Degen Generation). Tom’s persona is a fictional investigator, but he represents the creative efforts of Rich Tella/Bitjoin Studios. In the Indikin economy, Tom’s token is $GDAY (Gillespie Coin)
indikin.online
. Tom’s mission is “illuminating the rich tapestry of degen culture with [his] mates”
indikin.com
. Essentially, he brings an adventurous, investigative spirit to the Indikin creator roster.

Brian (Brian McGuire) – Founding Filmmaker. Brian is an award-winning indie filmmaker based in Los Angeles. With nine feature films under his belt, he is a director, writer, actor, editor, musician, and producer
indikin.com
. Brian’s style spans narrative films and likely experimental projects. In Indikin, he leads projects like Rabbit Hole. His token is $WUPIUPI (a playful name referencing an inside joke or character)
indikin.online
. Brian brings seasoned film industry experience to the team and bridges the gap between traditional indie cinema and the new Web3 model.

Georgia (Georgia Carrera) – Founding Filmmaker / Producer. Georgia is characterized as a “high-energy animator and producer based in LA” with extensive film industry experience and expertise in Web3
indikin.online
. She has a background in animation and production, and likely leads the Magic Universal Amphitheatre documentary project. Georgia’s token is $LOLA (often styled as “Lola Heart”)
indikin.online
. She injects creative energy and industry know-how, and is a key driver of the Indikin streaming content (her project is highlighted as an upcoming Indikin Original).

Dr. Al Teed – Founding Filmmaker / Strategist. Dr Teed (often just called “Dr Teed”) is a unique member of the team: “Seasoned business and brand strategist, creating genuine and meaningful business models for brands that make sense in the contemporary world.”
indikin.com
 He brings a strategic and perhaps academic perspective to Indikin. In addition, he has created a fictional persona of a time-traveling doctor which he uses in storytelling (the $TEED token and related content)
indikin.online
. His bio in character form says: “Dr Al Teed travels through time using $TEED tokens to uncover the secrets of history, documenting adventures through films, podcasts, and radio dramas.”
indikin.online
. This indicates he’s both contributing to creative content and to the business development of Indikin. Dr Teed’s dual role exemplifies how Indikin merges narrative and strategy.

Hal Samples – Founding Filmmaker. Hal is an eclectic creative: “Filmmaker – Clown – Photographer – Healer”
indikin.com
. His work often focuses on human connection and raw storytelling. Hal’s projects (like Organic Jim and the Samples of Society series) emphasize authenticity and social commentary. In Indikin he has the $HAL token and contributes a catalogue of documentary and art films. Hal’s presence ensures the platform remains artist-centric and grounded in real stories. His tagline is weaving a “vibrant tapestry of human connection, capturing life’s absurd beauty and mending souls”
indikin.online
.

Bitjoin Studios – Core Partner (Production Studio). Bitjoin Studios is the company behind the Indikin project
indikin.com
. It is listed among the “Indikins” likely as an entity with its own token ($SCOOT, representing Scootercoin)
indikin.com
bitjoinstudios.com
. Bitjoin blends media production, alternate reality game design, and blockchain integration
indikin.online
. The studio has been documenting blockchain’s rise since 2014
indikin.online
, and is co-founded by Rich Tella. Indikin is explicitly “a Bitjoin Studios Project”
indikin.com
. Thus, Bitjoin’s team provides the technical development (YalaCoder is noted as the developer), narrative design, and production infrastructure for Indikin.

YalaCoder – Full Stack Developer (PulseChain Specialist). Yala Coder is introduced as “PulseChain Full Stack Developer swimming with the whales of T-Shares.”
indikin.com
. This suggests he is a blockchain developer highly knowledgeable about PulseChain (T-Shares references HEX’s staking shares). Yala built the Indikin platform (the site footer notes “Built with ❤️ by YalaCoder.”
indikin.online
). His role is ensuring the smart contracts, website, and integrations (payments, NFTs, etc.) function smoothly on PulseChain. Being a PulseChain community member, he also connects Indikin to that blockchain’s ecosystem.

Tobiwan Hexobi – Advisor / Producer (PulseChain OG). Tobiwan is described as “OG PulseChain community member, experienced film producer, investor and advisor.”
indikin.com
. The moniker is a play on Obi-Wan Kenobi, hinting at a mentor role. Tobiwan brings film production experience and likely capital/investor relations. As a PulseChain OG, he helps bridge the crypto community with the film projects, perhaps advising on tokenomics and promotion within the chain’s fanbase. He’s one of the five community co-founders backing Indikin.

Igloobamboo – Advisor / AI Filmmaker. Igloobamboo is “OG PulseChain community member, experienced AI filmmaker, marketer and advisor.”
indikin.com
. This indicates he works with AI in filmmaking – possibly leveraging AI tools for content creation or marketing. His presence suggests Indikin is exploring AI-generated content or using AI for growth hacking. Igloobamboo likely advises on digital marketing strategies and the use of AI to scale content production or community engagement.

steady pup – DeFi Strategist. steady pup is listed as a “Liquidity pool strategist with PulseChain blue chips”
indikin.com
. In other words, he specializes in managing crypto liquidity and yield farming. For Indikin, steady pup likely helps with the financial mechanics: setting up liquidity pools for $INDIKIN and filmmaker tokens, optimizing those pools to reduce volatility, and guiding tokenomics adjustments. His expertise ensures the Indikin token economy remains healthy (avoiding shallow liquidity or excessive slippage) which is crucial for investor confidence.

LAO PIRATES – Community Moderator / Investor. LAO Pirates is noted as “OG PulseChain degen community member, knowledgeable investor and moderator.”
indikin.com
. This person likely handles community management (moderating Telegram/Discord) and brings in the perspective of the hardcore crypto investor (“degen”). By having someone deeply ingrained in crypto culture, Indikin can stay attuned to the community sentiment and maintain transparency. LAO Pirates helps keep the conversation with the community open and informed, and being an investor themselves, signals that insiders are invested alongside the public.

Additionally, the extended team includes Rich Tella (not listed by name on the site, but as a key Bitjoin Studios figure, he’s effectively the creator of Tom Gillespie persona and a driving force behind Indikin’s concept and content)
bitjoinstudios.com
. Shane Shuler and others appear in production credits of some films (e.g., Pulse of Consensus)
bitjoinstudios.com
, indicating a network of collaborators.

Summary of Roles: The Indikin team is unique in that many members wear two hats – they are both content creators (filmmakers) and builders of the platform. The five filmmakers (Tom, Brian, Georgia, Hal, Dr. Teed) each spearhead creative projects and bring their existing audiences and styles. The five PulseChain OGs (Yala, Tobiwan, Igloo, steady, LAO) ensure the crypto-economic and technical robustness of Indikin. Together, this hybrid team covers creative production, technical development, community management, marketing, and strategic oversight.

The collaboration is evident in weekly meetings open to prospective creators, and the synergy is encapsulated by the term “Independent Kinship” – it’s not just a platform, but a collective of indie creators and crypto enthusiasts building something new for film

6. Platform Documentation

The Indikin websites provide various informational pages and resources to help users (both creators and viewers) understand how the platform works. Below is an organized extract of key points from Indikin’s documentation, FAQs, and guides:

About Indikin (General FAQ)

What is Indikin? – “Indikin is an ecosystem that aims to accelerate the way independent productions are financed and distributed, providing a decentralized and inclusive platform for investors, filmmakers, and their audiences.”
indikin.online
. In essence, it’s a new model for indie filmmaking that leverages blockchain (PulseChain) to enable community funding and revenue sharing.

How to contact Indikin? – Via email at info@indikin.online
indikin.online
. They also invite community engagement through a Telegram chat (for token index discussions) and a Discord server (Creator Hub for filmmakers)
indikin.online
.

Joining the Community: – Users can join the Indikin Token Index chat on Telegram and the Creator Hub on Discord to participate in discussions
indikin.online
. (Links are provided on the site and in documentation.)

Tokenomics FAQ

What is $INDIKIN? – “$INDIKIN is the native Indikin Ecosystem Token. All Filmmaker tokens are bonded to it, which makes up the Indikin Token Index.”
indikin.online
. It’s the core currency of the platform that ties all projects together (see Tokenomics section above for details). Holding $INDIKIN gives exposure to all filmmakers and also yields PulseX rewards.

What are Filmmaker Tokens? – “Filmmaker tokens are unique tokens created by individual filmmakers within the Indikin ecosystem. 10% of each filmmaker’s token supply is allocated to the Indikin Production Fund.”
indikin.online
. These tokens represent individual film creators and allow fans to invest in specific filmmakers. The 10% deposit rule aligns each filmmaker with the communal fund.

What is the Indikin Production Fund? – “80% of the $INDIKIN supply is held in the Production Fund, used for ecosystem development, Indikin Grants, and further development of the film production fund.”
indikin.online
. This is the treasury for funding films and supporting creators (administered by the founding team). It collects the initial token allocation plus ongoing contributions and possibly a share of streaming revenue.

What are Indikin Grants? – “10% of the $INDIKIN in the Production Fund is distributed equally to filmmakers throughout the month.”
indikin.online
. This reiterates the grants program: a basic income for filmmakers, distributed presumably in $INDIKIN or stable value, proportionally or equally (exact mechanics may be refined, but this is the stated concept).

What is the Indikin Filmmaker Token Index? – “It is an index of all Filmmaker tokens that are bonded with the $INDIKIN token, representing the filmmakers producing under the Indikin label.”
indikin.online
. Essentially, it’s the composite of all creator tokens – by holding $INDIKIN, one holds a piece of this index. The index grows as more filmmakers join (with each new token bond, $INDIKIN supply is burned 0.1% to accommodate it)
indikin.online
.

Rewards for holding $INDIKIN? – “$INDIKIN token holders receive 1% $PLSX rewards on all swaps and transfers.”
indikin.online
. This confirms the reflection mechanism: any activity involving $INDIKIN generates PulseX (PLSX) rewards to token holders.

Funding & Distribution (How It Works)

How does funding work within Indikin? – “Funding combines a decentralized multi-token-based model with a ‘basic-income-like’ grants program. Filmmakers create their own tokens and contribute a percentage to the Indikin Production Fund.”
indikin.online
. In practice: a filmmaker issues a token, sells some to raise funds; they must give 10% of that token to the fund. Additionally, all filmmakers get monthly grants from the fund (once operational). This provides upfront capital and ongoing support.

How are distribution challenges addressed? – “Productions distributed via Indikin dedicated partner platforms and/or the native Indikin streaming platform (indikin.stream) can benefit from shared revenues.”
indikin.online
. Indikin streamlines distribution by ensuring that any film released through its platform (or affiliates) uses smart contracts to automatically split revenue among stakeholders. This solves the problem of filmmakers not getting fair returns – on Indikin, if your film is watched, you immediately get your share, and so do your supporters. The mention of indikin.stream suggests Indikin might have a specific domain or portal for streaming (currently Indikin.online serves that purpose, and possibly indikin.stream is a direct link or future site).

What is Indikin Streaming (IndiFlix)? – “Indikin Streaming (indikin.stream) is the native distribution arm of the Indikin Ecosystem, using split revenue enabled smart contracts for shared revenues from filmmakers’ productions.”
indikin.online
. This clarifies that IndiFlix (also referred to as Indikin Streaming) is a built-in streaming service where films can be rented or viewed, and the payments are automatically divided (film team, token holders, fund) by the smart contract. Indikin Streaming is the main way to watch Indikin films.

Revenue Sharing Mechanism: Only films distributed through Indikin’s platform get the benefit of automated revenue splitting to token holders and the fund
indikin.online
. If a filmmaker chooses other distribution channels, those earnings aren’t automatically shared via Indikin contracts. However, filmmakers are free to distribute elsewhere too if they wish
indikin.online
, but Indikin incentivizes using its platform by tying token rewards to it.

Payment Flow Example: A viewer uses a credit card or crypto to pay for a film on Indikin. The smart contract might do the following: convert that payment into a stablecoin or $INDIKIN; then instantly route X% to the filmmaker’s wallet, Y% to each token holder (perhaps by buying their tokens or via an airdrop), Z% to the production fund. This happens under the hood – the viewer just sees “purchase complete.” This flow is part of Indikin’s innovation.

Roadmap Highlights

(From Litepaper Roadmap & FAQ)

Token Launch Date: $INDIKIN was launched on April 4, 2025
indikin.online
. This marked “Day 0” of the ecosystem with initial token distribution and the beginnings of community formation.

Q2 2025 (Post-Launch): Setup of core structures – founding filmmakers received tokens and reciprocated with their token allocation to the fund; initial liquidity pools on PulseX were established
indikin.online
. Also around this time, development of the Indikin.online platform began (early 2025 focus)
indikin.online
.

July 2025: Development of the Indikin platform (IndiFlix site) commenced in earnest
indikin.online
. The team focused on the Production Fund setup and liquidity pool optimization, and held weekly AMAs for community feedback
indikin.online
.

August 2025: Internal testing of indikin.online started
indikin.online
. Outreach to potential partners on PulseChain was initiated, and community engagement campaigns (challenges, giveaways) were run to grow Telegram/Discord audiences
indikin.online
. Tokenomics were reviewed for potential improvements.

September 2025: Public invitation (beta launch) to the indikin.online platform was opened
indikin.online
. More partnerships and liquidity pools were established with core PulseChain coins and new filmmaker tokens
indikin.online
. Weekly AMAs continued.

IndiFlix Go-Live: On October 3, 2025, Indikin announced that IndiFlix went live on indikin.online, meaning the streaming service became available to users with initial content ready
bitjoinstudios.com
.

Late 2025: Regular content drops began (as evidenced by blog posts in Oct/Nov 2025 announcing new film releases on IndiFlix)
bitjoinstudios.com
bitjoinstudios.com
. Also, community events like “Big Wednesdays at Indikin” were held (weekly gatherings)
bitjoinstudios.com
.

Future Plans: The roadmap implies expanding to more blockchains (“More Chains Coming Soon” for $INDIKIN)
indikin.online
, continuous onboarding of new filmmakers (with token burns each time), and potentially launching new features (like the AI agent, merchandise marketplace for creators, etc. per Indikin Pass perks). As the Production Fund grows, 2026 will see the first grants and funded productions roll out, further validating the model.

Technology Stack

Blockchain: Indikin is built on PulseChain – an Ethereum fork with faster, cheaper transactions
indikin.online
indikin.online
. PulseChain’s native token is PLS. The choice ensures compatibility with Ethereum tools (Metamask, Solidity contracts) while tapping into the HEX/Pulse community.

Smart Contracts: Indikin uses a series of smart contracts for tokens and platform operations:

PRC-20 contracts for $INDIKIN and each filmmaker token (conforming to ERC-20 standards)
indikin.online
.

Custom contracts for the Indikin Index bonding and revenue splitting. These manage token bonding (perhaps using liquidity pool shares or an index fund logic) and the automated distribution of streaming payments.

A multi-sig wallet (Gnosis Safe) for the Production Fund to ensure secure, multi-party control over the large treasury
indikin.online
.

The platform likely also integrates with APIs for payment processing (NOWPayments for crypto, Stripe for fiat) as mentioned in policies
indikin.online
indikin.online
.

Front-end: The Indikin.online web app is built by YalaCoder. It supports social logins (Google, Discord) for user convenience
indikin.online
indikin.online
. It includes a Litepaper section (with extensive documentation as in sections above, directly on the site) and pages for FAQ, Privacy, etc., ensuring users can find information easily.

Security & Compliance: The site uses Cloudflare for backend support and security
indikin.online
. They implement COPPA compliance (no under-13 users, and under-18 cannot purchase passes)
indikin.online
, GDPR compliance (data rights, explicit cookie consent)
indikin.online
indikin.online
, and standard web security measures for accounts. The token contracts are presumably public and may have been audited (not explicitly stated, but likely given the community’s scrutiny).

User Onboarding Guides

For Viewers (Indikin Pass holders):

Sign-Up: Users can create an account on indikin.online (via email or Google/Discord sign-in)
indikin.online
. They must be 13+ (18+ to make purchases)
indikin.online
.

Purchase Indikin Pass: Through the Indikin Pass page, a user selects the current stage and checks out (Stripe for card payments or NOWPayments for crypto)
indikin.online
. Upon purchase, their account is marked with a 1-year access. The site notes purchases are final (no refunds) except required by law
indikin.online
.

Watching Films: With a Pass, the user can browse the Browse Films section. Currently, featured films are listed, and more content is “coming shortly”
indikin.online
. A user clicks a film, and if available, can stream it immediately. If a film is not yet released, they might see a trailer or “coming soon”. Pass holders do not pay per film (unlimited access).

Pay-Per-View (non-Pass): If a user hasn’t got a Pass, they might have the option to pay individually for a film (the platform supports one-off payments). In that case, at the film page, they would be prompted with pricing and payment options (traditional vs crypto)
indikin.online
indikin.online
.

Engaging & Rewards: Users can optionally connect a crypto wallet to receive any rewards (for example, if they decide to hold filmmaker tokens, or if they get $INDIKIN airdrops). Since pass holders at Stage 4/5 can earn creator token revenue, connecting a wallet would be necessary to collect that.

Community Involvement: Viewers are encouraged to join Discord/TG, attend weekly screenings or live chats (e.g., Indikin sometimes hosts “Movie Day” live streams on X where the community watches a premiere together, as seen with the Amphitheatre doc promotion)
x.com
.

For Filmmakers (Creators):

Apply to Indikin: Filmmakers fill out an application on Indikin.online, providing email, a description of their work/project, and portfolio links
indikin.online
. They might also simply reach out directly via community channels since the ecosystem is small and community-vetted.

Filmmaker Onboarding: If accepted, the filmmaker receives guidance to create their Filmmaker Token. This likely involves deciding a token name/ticker, total supply, and deploying it on PulseChain (with Indikin dev assistance). Once created, 10% of that supply is transferred to the Indikin Production Fund (as per rules)
indikin.online
.

Token Bonding: The new token is bonded to $INDIKIN. This might be done by creating a liquidity pool pair on PulseX (token vs $INDIKIN) and possibly a small $INDIKIN burn occurs (0.1% supply) to index it
indikin.online
. The result is the token now appears in the Index and on Indikin’s site (likely the profile of the filmmaker now shows their token price, DexScreener link, etc., just like for the founding five).

Funding & Production: The filmmaker can now raise funds by selling some of their token (the platform doesn’t specify how token sales are done – possibly through the open market or a presale to the community). Additionally, they become eligible for Indikin Grants (monthly support once that kicks in)
indikin.online
. They can also pitch for larger funding from the Production Fund for specific projects – e.g., in the monthly pitch sessions with founding filmmakers
indikin.online
.

Content Integration: As the project develops, the filmmaker can upload their film (finished or in-progress teasers) to the Indikin platform. There’s likely an interface for creators to manage their content (though not described in docs, it’s implied by the platform’s nature). Stage 3+ Pass holders get “global streaming distribution” support, meaning Indikin will assist in preparing and publishing their content on IndiFlix
indikin.online
.

Revenue Configuration: The filmmaker sets the revenue split for their project: what percentage goes to token holders, crew, fund, etc., when a sale happens
indikin.online
. This is done prior to release, probably via a smart contract or a form that Indikin’s team uses to program the split contract for that film.

Launch and Engage: The film is released on Indikin (either as a free for Pass holders or pay-per-view for others, depending on strategy). The creator is expected to engage with the audience – e.g., attend the weekly Indikin gatherings, do AMAs, share updates on Discord. This engagement keeps their token community active and can drive token value up (which funds them further).

Earnings and Payouts: Post-release, the filmmaker receives streaming revenue automatically. They can also see their token’s performance; if volume is high, their token holders (including themselves, presumably they hold a significant portion) will get PLSX reflections as well. The filmmaker can cash out tokens if needed or hold for upside. Also, they might periodically get grant disbursements in stablecoin from the fund.

User Protection & Moderation: The platform’s Terms outline acceptable use. Users should not upload illegal or copyrighted content without permission
indikin.online
. There are moderators (like LAO Pirates) ensuring community channels are civil and no scams proliferate. Indikin stresses compliance with laws (COPPA, GDPR, etc.) and has clear policies for data privacy and user rights (users can request data deletion, etc.)
indikin.online
indikin.online
.

Redeeming Codes: Indikin may offer coupon or promo codes (for example, early supporters might get a code for a free Pass). The Redeem page on Indikin.online allows users to enter an email and coupon code to unlock access
indikin.online
. This is straightforward and is part of onboarding if someone receives a promotional pass.

FAQ & Support: The FAQ page addresses common questions in categories (General, Tokenomics, Funding, Roadmap, Tech, Risks). For further help, users likely can reach out on Discord or email support. The Indikin team being small means early users often interact directly with the founders in chat.

Additional Learning Resources

Litepaper: Indikin’s Litepaper (available on the site) contains an in-depth discussion of the Problems, Solutions, Industry Data, Ecosystem mechanics, etc., much of which has been summarized in sections above
indikin.online
indikin.online
. It’s recommended reading for those who want the conceptual rationale behind Indikin.

Industry Data & Risks: The Litepaper also provides context on the creator economy and entertainment industry, citing that most full-time creators earn <$1k/year and face platform algorithm issues
indikin.online
, whereas traditional media is high-barrier, low-autonomy
indikin.online
. This reinforces why a hybrid model like Indikin is needed. It also lists DeFi risks (bots, impermanent loss, etc.) to acknowledge the pitfalls in the DeFi aspect of Indikin
indikin.online
indikin.online
. Indikin thus educates its users about these risks – for example, warning liquidity providers about impermanent loss, front-running, etc., in its FAQ
indikin.online
.

Social Media Guides: Indikin’s team has done introductions on platforms like YouTube (e.g., “Indikin Ecosystem Explained in 6 minutes” video posted Nov 1, 2025)
bitjoinstudios.com
. This likely serves as a quickstart guide for newcomers, explaining how to get involved either as an investor or creator. Additionally, Indikin’s presence on Instagram and Facebook often includes promotional explainers and reels (like Dr. Teed’s introduction reel on Instagram) to familiarize users with the concept in an accessible way
instagram.com
.

In summary, Indikin provides comprehensive documentation and support: from concept to practical steps. The FAQ addresses most high-level questions, the Litepaper dives into theory and strategy, and the Terms/Policies ensure transparency about user rights and obligations. The onboarding process, while involving crypto elements, is made user-friendly (e.g., social login, credit card payments, and a web streaming interface). Indikin’s educational approach (highlighting both opportunities and risks) helps set realistic expectations for participants in this new creator economy.

7. Ecosystem Projects

Indikin’s ecosystem extends beyond just a single website – it encompasses sub-brands and related initiatives that all contribute to the goal of a decentralized filmmaker economy. Key ecosystem projects and sub-brands include:

IndiFlix: This is the name given to Indikin’s streaming service arm. While technically part of Indikin.online, it’s branded as “IndiFlix” to emphasize its role similar to a streaming platform like Netflix, but for independent films on the blockchain. IndiFlix is described as “the streaming arm of Indikin; aiming to be the ecosystem of products and services catering to the creative industries.”
indikin.com
. In practice, IndiFlix = Indikin’s content library where one can watch the films. The launch of IndiFlix was a major milestone (announced October 2025)
bitjoinstudios.com
. All Indikin Original films and partnered indie content are released via IndiFlix. It’s integrated into Indikin.online (no separate site, though sometimes referred to as indikin.stream in docs). IndiFlix’s significance is that it provides a direct distribution channel for filmmakers, eliminating the need for YouTube, film festivals, or third-party streaming deals. It’s built with blockchain payment and split contracts at its core, which is novel for a streaming service.

Indikin Pass: Not exactly a separate project, but a distinct product in the ecosystem. The Indikin Pass initiative is essentially an early-supporter membership drive that finances the platform’s growth while rewarding supporters with access and perks. It’s somewhat analogous to a Kickstarter campaign but structured as a time-bound subscription. This concept of multi-tier passes (Stage 1–5) is unique and an important part of Indikin’s ecosystem narrative – turning early adopters into stakeholders. The Pass program also implicitly vets potential filmmakers (Stage 1 buyers showed interest in becoming filmmakers).

Indikin Filmmaker Token Index: As an ecosystem “project”, the Index could be considered a product in itself. It’s accessible via a Telegram bot or updates (since the FAQ references a Token Index chat on Telegram)
indikin.online
. The index may have a dashboard or tracking page. It is essentially Indikin’s own mini stock market for film tokens. The health and performance of this index project will reflect the overall ecosystem’s success. In the future, the team might package the index into an investable entity or DeFi product (e.g., an index fund token, though currently $INDIKIN itself serves that role).

Production Fund & Grants Program: These can be seen as sub-projects aimed at sustainability:

The Indikin Production Fund (with Gnosis Safe multi-sig) is the decentralized film fund that collects and deploys capital. It’s mentioned prominently across docs and is crucial for long-term viability
indikin.online
. The fund is likely to have its own page or status updates (e.g., reporting how many PLSX rewards it has, which projects got funded, etc.). This transparency will help gain trust from the community.

The Grants Program is effectively an internal project to provide UBI to filmmakers. Indikin might formalize it as it begins, perhaps listing monthly disbursements or spotlighting how grants helped creators. It’s part of the ecosystem’s value-add beyond just token speculation.

Gorge Pukas (AI Agent): This intriguing sub-project, promised to Stage 5 Pass holders, is an AI Filmmaking Industry Agent. It suggests Indikin is developing or integrating an AI bot named Gorge Pukas to assist users (perhaps answering questions about film production, funding, or even giving creative suggestions). This aligns with Indikin’s innovative bent. It’s likely an AI trained on filmmaking knowledge and possibly Indikin’s own data to act as a virtual mentor/consultant. This sub-brand could be an assistant built into the site or a chatbot in Discord for top-tier members.

Bitjoin Studios Projects: Since Indikin is a Bitjoin Studios project
indikin.com
, the broader Bitjoin portfolio is relevant:

Bitjoin has a Pipeline of content (as per their site)
bitjoinstudios.com
. Notable ones include Pulse of Consensus (2024), The Fakefluencer, Hexicans, etc., many of which are now under Indikin. Bitjoin’s continuing productions (like Big Wednesdays at Indikin video series or upcoming ARG projects) feed into Indikin’s content pool.

Bitjoin Studios Blog itself is a hub for ecosystem news – all Indikin updates are posted there (film drops, platform updates, etc.)
bitjoinstudios.com
bitjoinstudios.com
. It acts as the official news outlet for Indikin events.

“Independent Kinship” & Community Events: Indikin sometimes refers to Indikinship or Independent Kinship. This is more of a movement than a product – a community of like-minded indie creators and crypto backers. Ecosystem events include the weekly Google Meet gatherings for creators, and Indikin Movie Days – live broadcast events on social media where new film content is premiered (e.g., the Amphitheatre documentary had a Movie Day live stream with creators commenting)
x.com
x.com
. These events/brands (Big Wednesdays, Movie Day, etc.) form the cultural fabric of Indikin’s ecosystem.

PulseChain Integration Projects: Indikin is closely tied to PulseChain’s community. For example, $GDAY token holders were often PulseChain users who got airdrops when PulseChain launched
bitjoinstudios.com
. Indikin might partake in PulseChain events or collaborate with projects like Liquid Loans (which built the multi-sig they use)
indikin.online
. Also, Indikin’s social presence interacts with HEX/Pulse influencers. So one could consider the “$INDIKIN on PulseChain” awareness campaign a project – to be the premiere creative project on that blockchain (the tagline in marketing calls Indikin the biggest thing on PulseChain since Pulse’s own launch)
indikin.com
.

Educational Initiatives: Indikin appears to do community education, e.g., Indikin Ecosystem Explained videos, Dr. Teed’s podcast (where he interviews Tom Gillespie)
podcasts.apple.com
, and possibly future workshops. The presence of experienced members suggests mentorship programs might develop (veteran filmmakers guiding newcomers). These could become formalized as the Indikin Creator Academy or similar, though that’s speculative.

In conclusion, Indikin’s ecosystem projects revolve around creating an integrated cradle-to-grave system for independent films:

IndiFlix – distribution and streaming.

Token Index & $INDIKIN – funding and investment layer.

Production Fund & Grants – financing and sustainability.

Community (Indikinship) – support network and knowledge exchange.

Tech Tools (AI agent, platform features) – innovation to empower users.
All these sub-components work in concert. As Indikin grows, we can expect more sub-brands (perhaps an Indikin Marketplace for film NFTs or merchandise, since merch was mentioned in Pass perks
indikin.online
; or an Indikin DAO if they decentralize governance of the fund).

For now, the primary sub-brand to remember is IndiFlix – the streaming service brand – which is now live and acts as the public-facing content portal of the Indikin ecosystem
indikin.com

8. Legal / Policies

Indikin provides clear legal guidelines and disclaimers to ensure compliance and manage user expectations. The key points from their policies include:

Project Entity: Indikin.online is presented as a project by Bitjoin Studios
indikin.online
indikin.online
. This indicates Bitjoin Studios is the legal entity behind the platform. All policies begin by referencing Indikin.online and “we/us” as Bitjoin Studios’ project, anchoring responsibility.

Terms of Service (TOS): (Last updated July 21, 2025) Indikin’s TOS governs use of the site and services
indikin.online
. Important clauses:

Eligibility: Users must be 13 or older to use the site (COPPA compliance), and 18 or older to purchase the Indikin Pass or make any donations/payments
indikin.online
. By using the site, users confirm they meet these age requirements.

Account Sign-In: Users may sign up using Google or Discord OAuth
indikin.online
. They are responsible for account security. Indikin may store user email in browser local storage for convenience (with consent)
indikin.online
.

Purchases & Payments: All Indikin Pass sales and support payments are final and non-refundable (except if required by consumer law)
indikin.online
. Users are advised to ensure they input correct crypto addresses/amounts for payments; Indikin isn’t liable for user errors (e.g., sending to wrong address)
indikin.online
. Taxes on any purchases are the user’s responsibility per local laws
indikin.online
.

Content Ownership: All films, text, and images on Indikin are owned by Indikin or its partners (the filmmakers) and are protected by copyright
indikin.online
. Viewers are granted personal, non-commercial use only – meaning you can stream, but not re-upload or redistribute content. Any content users submit (like filmmaker application info or comments) can be used by Indikin to operate or promote the platform
indikin.online
.

Prohibited Use: Users may not engage in illegal activities on the site, infringe copyright, attempt to hack or disrupt the service, or provide false information
indikin.online
. Violations can result in suspension or termination of access, with Indikin enforcing this to maintain legal and platform standards
indikin.online
.

Revenue Sharing & Tokens: The TOS acknowledges the token aspect: “Some tokens (e.g., $GDAY, $LOLA) may offer revenue-sharing, as decided by filmmakers in compliance with applicable regulations. Indikin Production Fund: part of streaming revenue supports new film projects. No Guarantee: Revenue sharing and token benefits depend on filmmakers and market conditions. We do not guarantee financial returns.”
indikin.online
. This is a crucial legal disclaimer – it clarifies that any token-based earnings are not guaranteed or promised by Indikin (avoiding any suggestion of a security or investment contract). The actual distribution is at the filmmaker’s discretion (within what is legally allowed – so they must not promise something that violates securities law).

Third-Party Services: Indikin uses external services and disclaims liability for them. Specifically names: NOWPayments (crypto payment processor), Stripe (fiat payments), Google & Discord (login), Google Analytics, Microsoft Clarity (analytics), Cloudflare (infrastructure)
indikin.online
. Users are subject to those services’ terms and privacy policies as well. If those external services have issues or data breaches, Indikin is not responsible (though they likely choose trusted providers).

Limitation of Liability: Indikin provides the service “as is” without warranties, as much as permitted by law
indikin.online
. Liability of Indikin (Bitjoin Studios) for damages is generally limited to at most the amount the user paid in the last 12 months
indikin.online
. Indikin is not liable for any indirect damages like lost profits, etc., except where law disallows such exclusion
indikin.online
. This standard clause protects Indikin from being sued for, say, someone losing money on a token or a film not performing as expected.

Termination: Users can stop using the service or request account/data deletion at any time (via contact email)
indikin.online
. Indikin can terminate or suspend a user’s access if they violate terms or at their discretion (with notice), and will delete user data as per Privacy Policy when an account is terminated
indikin.online
. If access is terminated, any purchased content access might end – which is an important note for Pass holders (if you get banned, you might lose your remaining subscription period).

Governing Law & Dispute Resolution: The TOS states it is governed by the laws of the jurisdiction where Bitjoin Studios is based (not explicitly stated which, presumably Sweden or EU, given Rich Tella’s background, or possibly the UK or USA if Bitjoin is registered there)
indikin.online
. Disputes should be resolved by arbitration in that jurisdiction, no class actions allowed
indikin.online
, which is common in tech TOS. This ensures any legal challenges happen on Indikin’s “home turf.”

Privacy Policy: (Last updated July 21, 2025) Indikin’s Privacy Policy details data collection and usage, demonstrating compliance with GDPR and COPPA
indikin.online
. Key points:

Data Collected:

Email Address – collected for newsletter signups, Pass purchases, whitelist (waitlist) registration, and filmmaker applications
indikin.online

indikin.online
.

Payment Data – for crypto payments via NOWPayments, Indikin collects the user’s email, currency used, and transaction details (amount, wallet address)
indikin.online
. For Stripe payments, Indikin doesn’t get card details (Stripe handles those); Indikin just gets confirmation of payment.

indikin.online
.

Cookies for consent/language expire after 1 year
indikin.online
.

They promise to delete data when no longer needed, unless law requires retention
indikin.online
.

User Rights (GDPR): Users have rights to access their data, correct it, delete it, restrict processing, data portability, object to processing, and withdraw consent
indikin.online
. Indikin provides the contact (email) to exercise these rights and pledges a response in 30 days
indikin.online
. They mention users can unsubscribe from emails easily and clear cookies to opt-out of analytics, etc. Users can also contact their local Data Protection Authority if needed
indikin.online
.

Security: Indikin states they use secure systems for sign-in, payments, etc., to meet data protection standards
indikin.online
. They caution users to keep their devices secure as data stored in the browser (like email for forms) isn’t encrypted. Users can contact them for more info on security measures
indikin.online
.

Children’s Privacy: They reiterate the site is 13+ (and 18+ for purchases) and they don’t knowingly collect data from <13 children
indikin.online
. If a child’s data is mistakenly collected, they ask to be contacted to delete it
indikin.online
.

Third-Party Links: The site may link to external sites (e.g., a filmmaker’s profile might link to their YouTube or IMDb, or Stripe for payment) – Indikin isn’t responsible for those sites’ privacy practices and encourages users to check those sites’ policies (like Stripe’s)
indikin.online
.

Policy Changes: If they update the privacy policy, they’ll post it with a new “Last Updated” date and notify major changes via email or site notice
indikin.online
.

Contact: Provided contact email (info@indikin.online) for privacy queries or requests
indikin.online
.

Cookie Policy: (Last updated July 21, 2025) Outlines use of cookies in compliance with GDPR cookie consent rules
indikin.online
. Key points:

They use Essential Cookies for things like language preference (store chosen language for 1 year)
indikin.online
 – these are required for site function (so basically exempt from needing consent).

They use Analytics Cookies only if the user consents via the cookie banner
indikin.online
. If allowed, they store a cookie noting consent for a year, and then cookies for Google Analytics/Microsoft Clarity that collect anonymous usage stats (kept ~14 months)
indikin.online
.

They use Browser Storage (like localStorage) to save the user’s email if the user has filled it in a form (to pre-fill forms next time)
indikin.online
 – which is only stored with user’s implicit consent (user entering it and not clearing it).

User Choices: They have a cookie consent banner to allow/deny analytics (GDPR compliance)
indikin.online
. Users can change their mind by clearing cookies or contacting Indikin to update preferences
indikin.online
. Users can also block cookies in their browser, though essential cookies are needed for site to function (and they note blocking those might break things)
indikin.online
. They honor “Do Not Track” signals by disabling analytics if DNT is on
indikin.online
.

Third-Party Cookies: If analytics are allowed, Google Analytics and MS Clarity may set cookies. They ensure these providers adhere to privacy and data is anonymous (no ad tracking). They link to Google and Microsoft’s privacy policies for transparency
indikin.online
.

Rights: Reiterates that users have rights to data related to cookies too (access, delete, etc.), and to contact Indikin to exercise them
indikin.online
 (aligning with GDPR).

Changes & Contact: They will update the cookie policy as needed for law compliance and notify if major changes occur
indikin.online
. Provides contact email for questions or preference management regarding cookies
indikin.online
.

Disclaimer (Investment): Indikin prominently displays a disclaimer: “The information on this website is for educational and entertainment purposes only and should not be considered investment advice. Visitors should do their own research and consult a financial professional before making investment decisions.”
indikin.com
. This is legally important because Indikin deals with tokens that could be seen as investments; this statement aims to protect Indikin from claims that they gave financial advice or misled people about token profits. It sets the expectation that participating in token sales or buying $INDIKIN is at one’s own risk.

Content & IP Notice: By stating all rights reserved and asserting content ownership (films likely remain property of the filmmakers or Indikin under license), Indikin is protecting the creative IP on the platform. They also mention linking to filmmakers’ external profiles (IMDb, etc.)
indikin.online
indikin.online
 which is fine, but any external content is not Indikin’s liability (pointed out in policies regarding third-party links).

Safety & Moderation: While not a specific “policy” page, Indikin’s team composition (with moderators) and code of conduct implied in TOS (“don’t disrupt or post harmful content”) ensure a safe environment. They likely enforce community rules on Telegram/Discord as well (no harassment, etc., though not explicitly detailed in provided text).

Legal Jurisdiction: If Bitjoin Studios is EU-based, GDPR compliance is paramount – which they clearly address. The arbitration clause suggests perhaps Bitjoin might be based in a location where arbitration is standard (maybe EU or an international-friendly approach). They don’t explicitly mention an address or governing law beyond saying “where Bitjoin Studios is based”
indikin.online
. We might guess it’s Sweden or Estonia if Rich Tella’s involvement (as he’s worked from Sweden historically), but not confirmed in text. In any case, users should be aware that the platform operates under a certain jurisdiction’s laws which will handle any legal disputes.

In summary, Indikin’s legal framework is transparent and user-focused:

They openly detail what data they collect and why, aligning with privacy regulations.

They clarify user responsibilities and platform liabilities to avoid any ambiguity (especially around the financial aspects).

They ensure users are aware that this is a cutting-edge platform with no guaranteed outcomes, and that by participating, users accept the terms and risks.

They have put in place the necessary policies (Privacy, TOS, Cookie) to build trust and operate legitimately, which is crucial for a project that merges creative content with cryptocurrency elements.

Footer: Privacy, Terms, Cookie links
indikin.online
 and copyright (same as other pages).

Sign in with Google, Sign in with Discord (as suggested by mention in policies)
indikin.online
.

Possibly sign in with email if implemented, but likely social logins for ease. The interface wasn’t detailed in text, but expect a standard OAuth login page.

Privacy Policy Page: (indikin.online/privacy-policy) – Full text of Privacy Policy with headings (1. Info We Collect, 2. How We Use, etc., through 12. Contact Us)
indikin.online

indikin.online
indikin.online
indikin.online
. Footer same as others.

Cookie Policy Page: (indikin.online/cookie-policy) – Details cookies, sections (1. What are Cookies?, 2. Cookies We Use – broken into Essential, Analytics, Browser Storage lists, 3. How We Use, 4. Your Choices, 5. Third-Party Cookies, 6. Your Rights, 7. Changes, 8. Contact)
indikin.online
indikin.online
indikin.online
. Footer with nav links.

Contact Info: The site provides contact email at multiple places (info@indikin.online on Contact section of Litepaper
indikin.online
, and [email protected] in policies). Also social links and community links are readily accessible.

Social/External Integration:

There is likely an embedded Discord widget or at least prominent Discord/Telegram invite links (found in Contact and in site footer).

Filmmaker profiles link out to personal websites, IMDb, etc., making Indikin partly a hub linking to external credentials of creators.

Site Map Summary:

Home: (Indikin Pass, Films, Filmmakers, Ecosystem info, Litepaper content) – effectively serves as landing and documentation combined.

FAQ: (Detailed Q&A).

Redeem: (Coupon redemption).

Legal: Privacy Policy, Terms, Cookie Policy pages.

Login/Account: (likely an interface to view one’s pass status, possibly profile management but not explicitly described).

Indikin does not have a complex multi-level menu at this time; it’s a modern single-page app style for most content. The separation is mainly for FAQ and legal pages. As content expands (more films available), they might introduce a dedicated “Films” page or filterable library, but currently it’s a “Browse Films” section on home.

Note: Indikin also owns the domain indikin.stream mentioned in FAQ. It’s possible that indikin.stream simply redirects to indikin.online or a specific streaming subdomain, but currently it appears to be conceptual. The main entry remains indikin.online.

Overall, the site map is straightforward:

Indikin.com – marketing/intro one-pager.

Indikin.online – interactive platform with sections for all key functions (pass purchase, film browsing, info).

Subpages: /faq, /privacy-policy, /terms-of-service, /cookie-policy, /redeem, /login (and possibly /register if separate).

External links are used for things like viewing token charts (to DexScreener) and processing payments (NOWPayments, Stripe).

This structure makes it easy for users to navigate: the main site contains nearly everything with quick anchor links, and the supplementary pages handle specifics like FAQs and legal details.
